			<h3>  About how I entered the  Astana IT university</h3> 
			<p >  My name is Nursat, I am 18 years old. I am an ordinary guy who wants to achieve something in this life from the city of Semey, more precisely from the small village of Sergiopol.
				<br> 
				<br>
Literally 2 years ago, I just sat and looked at other people's sheep, which I had to graze and guard until the end of the day. Sat on the top of the hills with big dreams and a great desire to go at least to the city. I understood that if I didn’t act, study, I would stay in this village until the end of my days as our neighbor, who goes after cows every day from 6 am to 8 pm, spends half of his life with cows and thus receives minimal money.
<br>
By the 11th grade, I began to prepare for the UNT (Unified National Testing) and studied English at the same time. I was getting ready and accidentally saw an advertisement for Astana IT University on Instagram. Prepared for 9 months, got 101 points and was dissatisfied with the result 
<br> 
<br>
And so I entered Cybersecurity here and fate met me with honest and good people. At first, everything was difficult and it was not clear how the system works at the university, how to establish contact with classmates and teachers. It will already be a year since we go through difficulties in subjects with friends, how we teach each other and develop ourselves. Every day we come to the university together and leave together 
<br> 
<br>
When I entered this university,I thought that everything would be sweet and cool student life, but it turned out that everything was not so easy. It is more difficult to study at the university than at school, which even at the beginning went into depression because of some teachers. There are principled teachers who ask 36,000 questions, as if out of their own pockets, give a scholarship that is only 36,000 tenge. BUT we understand that it is precisely such situations that make a person a separate person, strengthen a person, instill in a student courage, critical thinking and prepare for an adult harsh life.
